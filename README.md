## Usage

Set your Quartz properties to something like this:

    # Use the MongoDB store
    org.quartz.jobStore.class=com.novemberain.quartz.mongodb.MongoDBJobStore
    # comma separated list of mongodb hosts/replica set seeds
    org.quartz.jobStore.addresses=host1,host2
    # database name
    org.quartz.jobStore.dbName=quartz
    # Will be used to create collections like mycol_jobs, mycol_triggers, mycol_calendars, mycol_locks
    org.quartz.jobStore.collectionPrefix=mycol
    # thread count setting is ignored by the MongoDB store but Quartz requries it
    org.quartz.threadPool.threadCount=1

## FAQ

### Why the Fork?

MuleSoft developers did not respond to attempts to submit pull requests for several months. As more and more
functionality was added and implementation code refactored, I decided to completely separate this fork form GitHub forks network because
the project is now too different from the original one. All changes were made with respect to the Apache Public License 2.0.
